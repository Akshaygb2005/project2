## Overview of the project
### **Project : Student Grade Management System**
### Objective
The objective of this Java program is to manage student data by allowing users to add students, assign and update subject grades, and delete or display detailed student information, including average marks.
### Key Activities
+ **Adding and Storing Student Data :** Users can input student names and assign multiple subjects with corresponding grades, which are stored in a nested HashMap structure for efficient data management.
+ **Updating and Managing Grades :**  The program allows users to update specific subject grades for each student and delete subjects when needed, ensuring dynamic data handling.
+ **Displaying Student Information :**  It provides a detailed overview of student performance, showing each subject's grades and calculating the average marks for easy assessment.
